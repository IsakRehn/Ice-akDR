                    2082/9/25:
                </span>
                 ITS ON AGAIN TONIGHT CHOOMS! Hope you klept enough eddies to bet on tonights race, <i>'cus i know you deckheads ain't earned em legally.</i><br>
                Anyways it's good to be back in season, the off time is always the worst for my depression. But ever since the 2082 opening race last week I'm feeling nova again. <br>
                Enough about me and on to the news this week. Apparently the Arasaka corpo link is planing a visit before the opening of this race. Word on the street is they're <br>
                checking in on some investment. My guess is they're unsatisfied with their chromed-out superstar Mercury's performance, hopefully they'll only do some mild interventions. <br>
                Though you know me I'm more of a Kattie-head anyways. <br><br>
                Oh! And in other news, apparently we're getting someone to fill in for Thedric(rip) and Molly after last weeks Boostergang incident. Peronsally not a big fan of getting <br>
                your crew involved, sets a bad precident, but hey can't really account for Cyberpsycho incidents, so we'll just have to take Ze-Yun's word when he says he wasn't inolved. <br>
                Good on him for pulling in some new meat though, some chromepunk from the water nomads that just recently arrived, Hantu Air I believe they call themselves. Drone work <br> 
                shows she's pretty damn good at driving. Her gunner is supposedly Mulyani, not surprising to see her enter the proverbial ring, she's worked on most cars racing on these <br>
                streets so it was only a matter of time. Damn preem work she does with them, I just hope she can shoot. So Overall I'm excited to see how they'll perform. <br><br>
                
            <span style="color: antiquewhite;"> 2082/9/18:</span> INPUTS AND OUTPUTS TONIGHT WE KICK OFF ANOTHER YEAR OF SHORT-CIRCED, PSYCHOED OUT, NOVA FUCKING RACES GOOOOOOOOOOONKS. <br> 
                LETS FUCKING GO. Down time always feels like hell. I need black lace, synthcoke or fucking glitter just to get through my day chooms. BUT NOT ANYMORE <span style="color: red;"> 8 </span> months of straight <br>
                fucking exctasy. Like a fucking XBD injected right into your veins. As you know tonights race is in Rancho Coronado, starting a bit slow with that boondocks shit but at least you know <br>
                the driving is gonna be preem. Ahh can you feel it? Proles lining the streets, sixth street rimbos showing their tits, its race night baby. Bonus points for anyone able to spot our favorite <br>
                lawman giving out tickets. Y'all remember last year? When he hung on to Lounges and Scizors car? You can't help but respect the fuck. Hopefully he'll top that shit. You runners think <br>
                we could actually get him to race one day? Maybe we could sell it like he gets a chance to pull them over and arrest them? Seriously imagine the scratch we could collect for that event. <br>
                <br>
                Anyways I'm just so excited for this shit to start up again. On to some actual news, this year we're gonna get even better quality for our streams. I was able to klep some Zetatech <br>
                drones, you know the Bombus? Those flying little spheres with even smaller wings all the megacorps use? Yeah got myself a tiny fleet of those bad boys. Claire pulled some <br> 
                strings, got some afterlife mercs to hijack a repair truck and slot my daemon onto their local subnet. We're gonna be using those to get some crystal clear shots and nova <br>
                angles. I did promise to shout them out though since they did good work for us. SO LISTEN UP GONKS, REMEMBER THE NAMES, ZONK, FIN AND JAMES. Good work you <br> 
                edgerunning fucks. <br>
                <br>
                <span style="color: antiquewhite;">2082/<span style="color: red;">9</span>/11:</span> Hey Chooms and Choombas, the site is once again coming out of hibernation and the site is once again ''sanitized'' as our lovely solos like to put it. Not much to report <br>
                on quite yet, this is mainly just a little hype up for whats coming. I'm in some talks to improve the quality of the streams but we'll see how it goes, no promises. I know how you <br>
                chromedomes get if I don't deliever on my promises. Learnt that lesson real well in last years plaza race. <b> <i> Fuck you Scavs, for real, gimme my Netdriver back you fucking posers </i></b> <br>
                <br>
                Thats about it for this early update though. Just wanted to say hi and that im back, and that we're rolling this year <i> just like every other year</i> DEATH RACE GEWALT, FUCK YEAH.
